## Lemonkey Repository
Download the repository from https://github.com/Artyy0m/lemonkey


## Creating Themes
After you download the repository, you can create your own theme. Create a CSS file in `/themes/css`. It should look something like this: `themes.css`.

Then add this code to your file:

```
body {
	background-color: #ffffff;
}
```

### Committing Themes
Once you have created your theme, now you need to create a repository.
